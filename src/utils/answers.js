    `Since I was a kid, music has always been my jam, and as I grew up, technology started to catch my eye. The idea of combining these two things always fascinated me, and eventually, I found myself immersed in the world of front-end development and smart contract programming, with a special focus on blockchain technologies. I taught myself the ins and outs of these areas through personal projects and collaborating with other developers, and the feeling of turning ideas into reality always drives me.`,

    `
  <p>While I'm proud of my accomplishments, I'm always looking for new challenges that stretch my skills and knowledge. I'm constantly seeking out opportunities to learn and grow, whether that means honing my existing skills or branching out into new areas. As a smart contract developer, I'm thrilled to be part of an industry that's always on the move, always innovating. For me, every project is a chance to discover something new and create solutions that can truly impact people's lives.</p>`,

    `My current tech stack consists of both front-end and back-end technologies, as well as smart contract development tools.`,
    `<p><br></p>`,
    `<p> On the front-end side, I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build responsive and engaging user interfaces. I also utilize React and Next.js to create dynamic and fast-loading web applications. For styling, I rely on TailwindCSS for its intuitive utility-first approach, as well as Framer Motion for seamless animation and interactivity. To connect my front-end with the blockchain network, I use ethers.js, which enables me to interact with smart contracts using Javascript and Typescript.</p>`,
    `<p><br></p>`,
    `
  <p>For back-end development, I prefer NodeJS as it provides an efficient and scalable runtime environment for server-side programming. I also use Socket.io for real-time communication between the server and the client, and mongoDB for storing and managing data.</p>`,
    `<p><br></p>`,
    `<p>Finally, for smart contract development, I work with Solidity as my primary programming language. I use hardhat as my development environment, which provides a suite of helpful tools for building and testing smart contracts. For Zero Knowledge Proofs integration i use circom.</p>`,

    `<p><br></p>`,
    `<p>Overall, I am comfortable and proficient in using this tech stack, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and experiment with new tools and technologies.</p>`,

    `Beyond coding, I have a few passions that keep me inspired and motivated. My biggest passion is music, which I've been involved with since a young age. From playing instruments to producing and recording my own tracks, music has always been a creative outlet for me.`,
    `<p><br></p>`,

    `<p>When I'm not making music or coding, I love to unwind with a good TV series. I've been known to binge-watch entire seasons in one sitting! It's a great way to recharge and get inspired by storytelling and character development.I'm also an avid basketball player and love nothing more than hitting the court for a game with friends. And when I'm in a more introspective mood, I enjoy playing chess, which helps me sharpen my strategic thinking skills.</p>`,
    `<p><br></p>`,

    `<p> Overall, these interests keep me balanced and energized, and I find that they often inspire my coding projects in unexpected ways.</p>`,

Although i am a big fan of TV series like The Office, Extras, Peep Show and more. If you have any recommendations for shows you think I'd enjoy, I'm all ears! ",
